                    We wanted to take a closer look at the content of each tweet,
                    so we decided to use <strong>K-Means clustering</strong> to
                    find topic clusters in the tweets. Prior to performing
                    clustering, we used NLP to help simplify the tweet texts in
                    order for the model to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We limit the model to only producing three clusters. This was
                    because, after some trial runs, we determined that limiting
                    the model to only three clusters produced more unique and easily
                    identifiable topics.

                    We have identified some sample tweets from each of the three
                    topic clusters and included them in the figure above. We 
                    identified the three topics to be as follows:

                    We use the Chi-Square test of independence to check if there
                    is a relationship between an account's <strong>stance on Sara</strong> and the type of the
                    account, which is either <strong>anonymous or identified (real names, official accounts, etc.)</strong> 
                    . We let our <strong>null hypothesis</strong> be that there is no relationship
                    between the two. The test produced the following results.
                </p>
                <p><ol class="container" style="font-size: large;">
                    <li><strong>Chi-Square Statistic = 7.92</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>P-Value = 0.019</strong></li>

                <p class="bodyText">
                    For the test, we assume a confidence of 95% or an alpha value
                    of 0.05. We can see that the <strong>P-value is less than the
                    alpha value</strong>. Thus, we can reject the null hypothesis.
                    However, the <strong>Chi-Square statistic</strong> is somewhat
                    low. Because of this, we cannot say that there is a particularly 
                    strong relationship present between the account's stance on
                    Sara and the account type.
