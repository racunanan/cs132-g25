                            Missing Data

                <p>
                    The missing values in the dataset were primarily under
                    categorical fields such as "Location" and "Account bio".
                    The word "<strong>N/A</strong>" was used as the default value for these 
                    fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fields that were filled in this manner are the following:
                </p>
                <p><ol class="container">
                    <li>Account bio</li>
                    <li>Location</li>
                    <li>Tweet Translated</li>
                    <li>Screenshot</li>
                    <li>Rating</li>
                    <li>Remarks</li>
                </ol></p>
                <p>
                    For the "Quote Tweets" field, the default value is <strong>
                    0</strong>. We can safely assume that no Quote Tweets would
                    mean that there were no Quote Tweets for that particular post.
                    As for the "Views" field, we have decided to omit it from the
                    dataset. This was because there were too many missing values 
                    and available view counts vary greatly. It is difficult to 
                    assume how many views a tweet has.

                    The values under the "Dates posted" field were also editted
                    to fix some inconsistencies with the format. The format used 
                    in this field is "<strong>DD/MM/YY HH:MM</strong>". Some values 
                    were found to have a 4-digit year value so this was editted 
                    during preprocesssing.

                    To get an understanding of the follower counts of the accounts 
                    in the dataset, the values under the "Followers" were standardized.
                    This was done with the help of the <strong>scikit-learn</strong>
                    package of Python to help produce the <strong>zscores</strong>
                    needed. This is to ensure that the values are scaled relatively
                    close to each other.

                    In the graph above, notice that there is <strong>one</strong>
                    notable outlier. We found out that the outlier account had 
                    50K+ followers as opposed to the typically 4-digits or less
                    of other accounts. This outlier was then removed to produce
                    another zscore distribution.

                    The graph above shows a better distribution of the zscores

                    To allow ease of use during data visualization, some
                    categorical fields were encoded using <strong>One-hot encoding</strong>
                    to convert them to numerical fields. These fields are the 
                    "Account type" and "Stance on Sara" fields. The "Stance on Sara"
                    field was a field added during Data Collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One-hot encoding is a method for converting categorical data 
                    into numerical data by splitting the categories into their own 
                    columns and assigning each row either a <strong>1</strong> or
                    <strong>0</strong>. A <strong>1</strong> denotes the feature 
                    that a particular row possesses and vice versa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A One-hot encoding of the "Account type" field would look as

                    To simplify the tweets collected, NLP was done to help breakdown
                    each tweet content to a form that is suitable for machine learning.
                    NLP was made possible with the help of the <strong>Natural Language Toolkit</strong>
                    package of Python.

                <h3 style="color: brown">Tokenization and Lower-casing</h3>
                <p>
                    Tokenization was done by running the function shown below.

                <p>
                    For a tweet that says "<strong>The new admin wants to 
                        abolish the K-12 system. Imagine tayong mga estudyante
                        na naghirap for additional 2 years tas may balak iabolish

                        That doesn't seem fair

                <h3 style="color: brown">Stop Words Removal</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to the mix of English, Filipino, and a case of Cebuano,
                    some external packages were loaded to help identify these 
                    stop words. The function below loads a list of stopwords from 
                    the three languages stated and removes the words from the tweets.

                <p>
                    The last NLP process done was lemmatization. This process 
                    reduces words to their root form as opposed to Stemming, which
                    reduces words to a basic word that may or may not make sense
                    given some context. The function below performs the lemmatization 
                    process.

                    The following graph shows a comparison of the stances of each 
                    account on Sara Duterte. For each stance, we separated the "Identified"
                    accounts from the "Anonymous" accounts. We opted not to include
                    "Media" accounts since none of the tweets collected came from a 
                    media account.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From the graph, we an see that a majority of the accounts that 
                    were collected have an <strong>Ambiguous</strong> stance.
                    It can also be seen that <strong>Anonymous</strong> accounts 
                    are more numerous than Identified accounts.

                    The following graph shows an analysis of the dates when the
                    tweets were posted. Before graphing, the dates were binned into 
                    <strong>Month and Year</strong> to reduce the size of the graph 
                    and the number of points.

                    From the graph, we can see that the amount of posts relating

                    "Likes", "Replies", "Retweets", and "Quote Tweets" field.
                    The graph used is a heatmap that shows the correlation of 
                    multiple fields. The specific correlation used is the <strong>Pearson
