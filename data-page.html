                    We collected data from Twitter using both <strong>manual</strong>
                    collection and <strong>automated</strong> collection. For the
                    manual collection, we manually browsed Twitter to scrape
                    tweets that were relevant to our topic. For the automated 
                    collection, we used the <strong>snscrape</strong> package
                    in Python to automatically collect tweets with some given
                    parameters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tweets that were collected were only the tweets that were
                    posted between the year <strong>2016</strong> and 
                    <strong>2022</strong> (inclusive). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For both the manual and automated data collection, we used
                    the following keywords:
                </p>
                <p><ol class="container">
                    <li>abolish k-12</li>
                    <li>sara k-14</li>
                    <li>K-14 sara duterte</li>
                    <li>sara k-12</li>
                </ol></p>
                <p>
                    Note that the list of keywords above is <strong>not 
                    exhaustive</strong>. This means that any combination of the above
                    words were used as well as different capitalizations to help
                    find relevant tweets. Tweets were collected during the months
                    of March and April.

                    In order to determine the particular stance of an account 
                    with Sara Duterte, we made sure to check for
                    <strong>more than 1</strong> tweet that implies their stance.
                    This means we check for other tweets that the account has made
                    (other than the collected tweet) that implies their stance.
                    This is only applicable to accounts that do not explicitly 
                    state their stance on Sara Duterte.
                </p>
                <p class="bodyText">
                    We also consider their <strong>support for another person</strong> as a basis
                    for determining the stance of an account. An example is that
                    we consider Kiko Pangilinan supporters as Anti-Sara due to
                    Kiko Pangilinan being a VP candidate like Sara Duterte during
                    the 2022 elections.

                <p class="bodyText">
                    Accounts that only made 1 post regarding Sara Duterte or have
                    conflicting opinions are considered <strong>Ambiguous</strong>.
                    We also considered <strong>Marcos supporters</strong> that <strong>made no mention
                    of Sara Duterte</strong> as Ambiguous even if the accounts that we
                    determined to be Pro-Sara were also Marcos supporters. A total
                    of <strong>150 tweets</strong> were collected.
